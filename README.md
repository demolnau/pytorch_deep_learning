## Definitions
### Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates human learning so that an application can adapt to uncertain or unexpected conditions.
AI is designed to allow an application to permform taks that would typically requirte human cognitive functions such as:
- Discovering new information
- Learning or reasoning
- Language understanding

### Machine learning
Defined as a subset of AI
To buils a learning system, three essential components are needed:
 - input data
 - processing
 - output layer

A set of techniques that enable a computer to learn from data and use that to provide an answer
Used on low dimentional data and small volumes of data

### Deep Learning
Subset of Machine Learning
Uses neural layers of nonlinear transformations to progressively extract features from raw inputs
Used on high dimentional data and on large volumes of data
Used on:
- speech recognition
- anomaly detection
-  machine translation
- speech-to-text translation
