# PyTorch
- Python library designed for deep learning projects.
- Developed by FAIR for large scale image analysis (objectification, segmentation, and classification). 
- Released in 2016
- Written in Python and C++

Specifically designed to:
- Easily run array-based calculations
- build dynamic neural networks
- perform auto-differentiation for GPU



> ## Definitions
> ### Artificial Intelligence
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates human learning so that an application can adapt to uncertain or unexpected conditions.
> AI is designed to allow an application to permform taks that would typically requirte human cognitive functions such as:
> - Discovering new information
> - Learning or reasoning
> - Language understanding
>
> ### Machine learning
> Defined as a subset of AI
> A set of techniques that enable a computer to learn from data and use that to provide an answer
> Used on low dimentional data and small volumes of data
> To build a learning system, three essential components are needed:
>  - input data
>  - processing
>  - output layer
>
> ### Deep Learning
> Subset of Machine Learning
> Uses neural layers of nonlinear transformations to progressively extract features from raw inputs
> Used on high dimentional data and on large volumes of data
> Used on:
> - speech recognition
> - anomaly detection
> -  machine translation
> - speech-to-text translation
